**Points:** 250  

**Challenge statement:**  
> "Guess the key get the flag! Easy hn yar."

---

## Files provided
- `Babyreversing` â€” ELF binary (x86_64)

---

## Reproduction (what players see)
Run the binary and enter any key:

```bash
$ ./Babyreversing
Enter the secret key: test
Wrong key!
When the correct key is entered:

bash
Copy code
$ ./Babyreversing
Enter the secret key: stealthworm
Correct! The flag is: SW{3334rev3032}
Quick solution (one-line)
The correct key (stealthworm) appears as readable text inside the binary. Using strings reveals the key, which yields the flag SW{3334rev3032} when provided to the program.

Step-by-step analysis & solution
1. Basic file info
Check the binary type:

bash
Copy code
$ file Babyreversing
Babyreversing: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, ...
Run it to observe behavior:

bash
Copy code
$ ./Babyreversing
Enter the secret key: abc
Wrong key!
2. Quick static check with strings
strings is a fast way to look for human-readable text inside a binary. It often reveals prompts, hardcoded keys, or flags in beginner challenges:

bash
Copy code
$ strings Babyreversing | grep -i "Enter\|Correct\|Wrong\|stealth"
Enter the secret key:
stealthworm
Correct! The flag is: SW{
Wrong key!
The presence of stealthworm in the strings output strongly suggests that is the expected key.

3. Verify by running the binary with the discovered key
Use the discovered key:

bash
Copy code
$ ./Babyreversing
Enter the secret key: stealthworm
Correct! The flag is: SW{3334rev3032}
This confirms the key and reveals the flag.
